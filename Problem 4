1. Formulate at least 5 different structural testing goals (e.g., reaching a particular state,
exercising a specific transition, reaching the same state twice, etc.). (10 Points)
    1. Reach a state in which traffic_light_NS and traffic_light_EW are red and the same time. 
    2. Reach the transition between traffic_light_EW being YELLOW and traffic_light_EW being RED.
    3. Show that if the traffic_light_NS is green and the traffic_light_EW is RED, we must eventually reach a state in which the traffic_light_NS is red and the traffic_light_EW is green.
    4. Reach the transition between ped_light_NS being WAIT and WALK.
    5. Show the emergency_sensor_NS being disabled.
2. Show the trap properties that you derived for each of the test goals. (10 Points)
    1. SPEC AG ! (traffic_light_NS = RED & traffic_light_EW = RED)
    2. SPEC AG ! (traffic_light_EW = YELLOW & EF traffic_light_EW = RED)
    3. SPEC AG ! ((traffic_light_NS = GREEN & traffic_light_EW = RED) -> EF (traffic_light_NS = RED & traffic_light_EW = GREEN))
    4. SPEC AG ! (ped_light_NS = WAIT & EF ped_light_NS = WALK)
    5. SPEC AG ! (emergency_sensor_NS = TRUE & EF emergency_sensor_NS= FALSE)

3. Check those properties using NuSMV on your traffic lights FSM and show the test cases
you obtained from the counter-examples produced by the tool. (5 Points)
    See file `trap_traces`

You must submit your trap properties and the NuSMV output file which contains your test cases.
You only need to redirect NuSMV output to a file and submit it, do not edit the output file.
