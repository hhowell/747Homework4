1. Formulate at least 5 different structural testing goals (e.g., reaching a particular state,
exercising a specific transition, reaching the same state twice, etc.). (10 Points)

2. Show the trap properties that you derived for each of the test goals. (10 Points)

3. Check those properties using NuSMV on your traffic lights FSM and show the test cases
you obtained from the counter-examples produced by the tool. (5 Points)


You must submit your trap properties and the NuSMV output file which contains your test cases.
You only need to redirect NuSMV output to a file and submit it, do not edit the output file.
